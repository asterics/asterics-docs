## General Information

These instructions will help you to install the open-source-software AsTeRICS. The
installation process will be described step-by-step.

## Definition AsTeRICS

"Assistive Technology Rapid Integration and Construction Set".
With AsTeRICS, you can easily and economically build, use and adapt your efficient
and individual "Assistive Technologies". The input capabilities of AsTeRICS are very
flexible. AsTeRICS can be used and combined with different input-devices such as a
webcam, switches or an on-screen scanning keyboard.
The various output-capabilities of the system include PC device emulation, game
control, environmental control applications and utilization of embedded devices.

## Definition ACS

AsTeRICS Configuration Suite is a graphical editor for easy building and adapting
"Assistive Technologies".
For this purpose you use sensors, actuators and processors, which are included in
the software. You can connect these elements and build your own individual setup
(also called a "model"), which is specially adapted for your needs, easily and fast.

## Definition ARE

The AsTeRICS Runtime Environment is the basic software framework for all
AsTeRICS applications and use-cases. The models built in the ACS will run in the
ARE. The ACS can be seen as a configuration program for the ARE.
