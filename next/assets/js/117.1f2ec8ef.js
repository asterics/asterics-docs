The first one is channels, where data is transported from one component to another. The second one is the events-concept. Events are single or continuous happenings, which should trigger an action at the receiver. After an event channel has been established between a trigger and a listener, the events have to be set in the events tab (which appears in the property area - by default on the right side of the ACS). In this event tab, there is a table with two columns: the left column lists the event listeners, the right column the event triggers. So, with the selection box on the right side (second column), the triggering event for the listener will be set. One component can send and receive events from several other components.
